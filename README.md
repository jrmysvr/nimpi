# Nim and the Raspberry Pi Zero

Using WiringPi (https://github.com/ThomasTJdev/nim_wiringPiNim, https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi) to interact with a raspberry pi zero.

The `ressources` directory is needed for now and is copied from https://github.com/ThomasTJdev/nim_wiringPiNim.

Built with docker:

> ./build_docker && ./run_docker

On the pi:

> sudo ./nimpi
